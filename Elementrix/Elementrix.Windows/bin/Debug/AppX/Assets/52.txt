Tellurium
Tellurium is far more common in the universe as a whole than it is on Earth. Its extreme rarity in the Earth's crust, is partly due to its high atomic number, but also due to its formation of a volatile hydride which caused the element to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of the planet.
